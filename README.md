# Divisibility Checker

This Java program checks the divisibility of numbers up to a given input by 5.

## Description

This program takes an integer input from the user and then checks each number from 1 up to the input value. It prints whether each number is divisible by 5 or not. The program consists of a single Java class, `Dev`, with a `main` method that handles the user input and the checking process.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the `Dev.java` file.
2. Compile the Java file using a Java compiler, for example:

3. Run the compiled Java program:

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter an integer value.


## Note

- The program first prints the numbers that are not divisible by 5, then prints those that are divisible by 5.
- If no number up to the input value is divisible by 5, the second part of the output won't be printed.
